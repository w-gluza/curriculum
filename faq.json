        "a":"Students who fail the first exam attempt are offered two more attempts. Re-exams are held within two months of the first attempt. The extent of the re-exam is based on an academic assessment of the reason for the need for a re-exam. The purpose of the re-exam is the same as for the ordinary exam."
